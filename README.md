# 🧩 Programming 4 – Howest DAE (2024)

Hey there, fellow DAE developer, future engine programmer, or just a curious explorer 👋  
Welcome to my **Programming 4** repository — the final chapter in the DAE programming series.  
This semester focused on **software architecture**, **design patterns**, and **efficient C++ engineering**, setting the stage for larger-scale game projects and engine development.

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains all **lab exercises** and **weekly projects** from the **Programming 4** course at **Digital Arts & Entertainment**, **Howest University**, **Kortrijk, Belgium**.  
Like earlier semesters, each week’s work is preserved for **archival and learning purposes** — showing progression in problem-solving, software design, and engine-level thinking.

> ⚠️ These projects were made in an academic setting.  
> Expect incomplete features, testing code, and exploratory experiments.  
> It’s not a finished framework — it’s a **development journey snapshot**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each **week** has its own **branch**, e.g.  
  - `03` → Week 3  
  - `10` → Week 10  
- Each branch focuses on a specific programming or design pattern topic.

## 🚀 Releases

Weekly compiled builds are archived in the [📦 Releases](../../releases) section.  
Example:

`programming_4-10-1.0.0-windows-x64.zip`

Each release represents a stable snapshot of the week’s lab assignment or pattern implementation.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

**Programming 4** was all about thinking **beyond syntax** — understanding how to build maintainable systems, structure reusable components, and manage complexity at scale.  
It marks the transition from “writing code” to **designing software**, bridging the academic foundation with the mindset required for professional game and engine development.

If you’re currently at this point in DAE: learn the patterns, experiment with architecture, and remember — **elegant design always outlasts clever hacks** 🧠💡
